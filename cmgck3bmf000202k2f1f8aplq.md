Today marks the start of my cloud learning journey, and Day 1 was all about exploring the **fundamentals of AWS and cloud computing**. Here’s a quick summary of what I learned:

## AWS Pricing Models

AWS offers different pricing options to fit diverse use cases:

* **On-Demand** – Pay only for what you use, with no long-term commitment. Best for short-term or unpredictable workloads.
    
* **Savings Plans/Reserved Instances** – Commit to using AWS resources for 1–3 years in exchange for significant cost savings. Great for steady workloads.
    
* **Spot Instances** – Purchase unused AWS capacity at a discount (up to 90%), ideal for flexible or fault-tolerant workloads.
    
* **Dedicated Hosts** – Rent entire physical servers for compliance or special licensing requirements.
    

In short, AWS lets you choose between **flexibility vs. cost savings** depending on your workload.

## On-Premises vs. Cloud vs. Hybrid

* **On-Premises** – All hardware, networking, and software are managed in-house. Provides control but comes with high upfront cost and maintenance.
    
* **Cloud** – Resources are delivered on-demand by providers like AWS. Scalable, cost-effective, and fast to deploy.
    
* **Hybrid Cloud** – Mix of both. Businesses keep sensitive workloads on-prem while using the cloud for scalability.
    

Example: A bank may keep core transaction systems **on-premises** for security but use the **cloud** for analytics and customer apps.

## IaaS, PaaS, SaaS Explained

* **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** – Provides virtual servers, storage, and networking. Example: **Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine**.
    
* **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** – Provides a platform to build and deploy applications without managing infrastructure. Example: **AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku**.
    
* **SaaS (Software as a Service)** – Ready-to-use applications delivered via the cloud. Example: **Gmail, Dropbox, Salesforce**.
    

👉 Think of it like this: IaaS = raw materials 🧱, PaaS = a semi-built house 🏠, SaaS = fully furnished apartment 🛋️.

## The History of AWS

* **2002** – AWS launched with basic web services.
    
* **2006** – Amazon EC2 and S3 officially launched (true start of cloud as we know it).
    
* **2012** – AWS re:Invent conference began.
    
* **2015** – AWS revenue hit $7.88B, proving cloud as a business model.
    
* **2021+** – AWS remains the global cloud leader, powering startups to enterprises worldwide.
    

What started as an internal Amazon project is now the **world’s most widely adopted cloud platform**.

## Reflection

Cloud is not just about servers in someone else’s data center—it’s about **agility, scalability, and innovation**. Day 1 gave me a clear foundation, and I’m excited to dive deeper into hands-on learning ahead.
