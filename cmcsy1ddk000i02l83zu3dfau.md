# Challenge 2

---

## 🚀 Introduction

This week’s challenge focused on **advanced Git concepts** essential for any DevOps professional. Whether working solo or in a team, mastering Git’s powerful features like **pull requests, stashing, resetting, and branching strategies** helps keep workflows efficient and collaborative.

Here’s what I worked on in Week 4, and how it deepened my understanding of Git in real-world DevOps environments.

---

## 🧩 Task 1: Pull Requests – Collaborating Like a Pro

### Scenario

Created a new feature, committed it to a branch, and opened a **Pull Request (PR)** to merge into the main branch.

### 🔧 Steps I Followed:

✅ Created PR on GitHub, requested a review, and merged after approval.

### 💡 Key Takeaways:

* Always write clear PR descriptions.
    
* Use checklists to verify readiness.
    
* Respect code review comments — they improve your code and understanding.

## 🔁 Task 2: Undoing Changes – Reset & Revert

### Scenario

Accidentally committed the wrong code and needed to undo it using different Git reset modes.

### 🔧 Commands Used:

```plaintext
bashCopyEditgit reset --soft HEAD~1     # Keeps changes staged
git reset --mixed HEAD~1    # Unstages changes but keeps files
git reset --hard HEAD~1     # Discards everything
git revert HEAD             # Safely creates a new commit that undoes the previous one
```

### 🧠 Learning:

* Use **revert** in public branches to avoid rewriting history.
    
* Use **reset** in local/private branches when safe to discard/rewrite.

## 🗂️ Task 3: Stashing – Saving Work Temporarily

### Scenario

Needed to switch branches but didn’t want to commit incomplete changes.

### 🔧 Commands Used:

```plaintext
bashCopyEditgit stash
git checkout main
git stash pop  # Also explored git stash apply
```

### 💬 Notes:

* `git stash pop` removes the stash after applying.
    
* `git stash apply` keeps the stash intact for reuse.
    
* Great for mid-task interruptions or quick hotfixes!

## 🍒 Task 4: Cherry-Picking – Applying Specific Commits

### Scenario

Needed a bug fix from another branch without merging all its changes.

### 🔧 Commands Used:

```plaintext
git log --oneline
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

✅ Resolved conflicts and used `git cherry-pick --continue` to finish.

Conflict resolved manully

:  

### ⚠️ Risks:

* Cherry-picking can introduce **duplicate commits**.
    
* Best for isolated fixes, not large features.
    

---

## 🔀 Task 5: Rebasing – Keeping a Clean History

### Scenario

My branch was behind `main` and needed updates without merge commits.

### 🔧 Commands Used:

```plaintext
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main
git rebase --continue
```

### 🔍 Key Difference:

* `merge` keeps all commits but adds a merge commit.
    
* `rebase` rewrites history to make it linear and clean.
    

### ✅ Best Practices:

* Only rebase local changes.
    
* Avoid rebasing shared branches without coordination.

## 🌳 Task 6: Industry Branching Strategies

I explored and simulated these workflows using Git branches:

1. **Git Flow** – Feature, Release, Hotfix branches
    
2. **GitHub Flow** – Main + Feature branches
    
3. **Trunk-Based Development** – CI/CD + short-lived feature branches
    

### 📌 Which One’s Best?

| Strategy | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Git Flow | Structured, good for releases | Can be heavy for fast-paced CI/CD |
| GitHub Flow | Simple, ideal for GitHub projects | Lacks release branch support |
| Trunk-Based Dev | Great for CI/CD | Requires automation & discipline |

## 📸 Bonus: Screenshot from My Solution

> “Used `git reset --soft HEAD~1` to undo a commit while keeping changes staged. Super handy during experimentation!”  
> “Rebased my feature branch with `origin/main` to maintain a linear commit history. Less clutter, more clarity!”

---

## 🙌 Conclusion

This week gave me practical, hands-on exposure to Git’s advanced capabilities. I now feel more confident contributing to collaborative projects and managing real-world version control challenges.

Thanks to #90DaysOfDevOps for pushing us to go depth of the concepts.
